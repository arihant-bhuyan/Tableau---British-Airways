### **2. Graphical Visualizations and their True Potential**

#### **Average Overall Rating by Month (Line Chart)**

- This graph can dynamically change based on the selected metric. For instance, it can show overall trends in **entertainment** or **food ratings**.
  
#### **Analyst Use**:
- With a **date filter** applied, users can track **performance trends** over time. If an airline rolls out a new menu or introduces a new entertainment system, this trend line can show the direct impact of that change.

## **Average Rating by Aircraft (Bar Chart)**

- The aircraft bar chart is linked to specific aircraft models (e.g., **Boeing 747**, **A320**). This allows the analyst to drill down into specific aircraft types to understand whether **older or smaller planes** receive lower ratings compared to newer, larger models.

#### **Analyst Use**:
- Airlines can decide on **fleet upgrades** or improvements based on feedback from specific aircraft, using this data to **retire underperforming models** or enhance services for highly reviewed ones.

## **Number of Reviews by Aircraft (Secondary Bar Chart)**

- This chart can be used to determine the **volume of feedback** for each aircraft type. Aircraft models that receive **high volumes of low-rated feedback** can be flagged for further investigation or service improvements.

#### **Analyst Use**:
- Prioritize **aircraft models** for deeper investigation based on high feedback volume but low ratings.
